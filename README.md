This is Python code for my team Submission on Big Data Challenge IPB University 2020.
This code use Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, NLTK, JcopML, and XGBoost package. 
The objective of this competition is to classify whether a news article is a hoax or no from text data. 
For training, we used bayesian search cross validation to find best hyperparameter and used XGBoost Classifier algorithm for training the model.
